Proofle: A Privacy-Preserving Online Dating in Blockchain

_Zero-Knowledge in Mind, Infinite Love in Heart_

The number of individuals actively participating in online dating has been drastically surging up over the recent years. Accordingly, they have been revealing a significant amount 
of private information about themselves. In this work, we propose a novel privacy-preserving and partially-decentralized dating protocol (i.e. Proofle) based on zero-knowledge proof
on blockchain where the user attributes and preferences are private to the other users. The proposed protocol establishes trust between the users and the trusted party by allowing 
the correctness of the zero-knowledge proofs to be verified on-chain. The protocol consists of several layers including the zero-knowledge proof, blockchain, API server, database
and web user interface layers. We have analyzed the protocol with respect to the security perspective in order to identify its strengths and weaknesses. We have also carried out 
the extensive experimental study on the reference implementation of the protocol to measure blockchain gas consumption, proof size, proof generation/verification times and server 
response times. The experimental results justify the correctness and the applicability of our protocol.

# To Run

Our application needs all its layers to be running.

1. Install and configure Metamask extension on browser for Avalanche Fuji Testnet.
2. Deploy Proofle contract to blockchain. (Blockchain layer completed...)
3. Run Web UI (/WebUI) with ```node server.js``` on port 3300.
4. Open Web UI on browser with ```http://localhost:3300/```. (Web UI layer completed...)
5. Update ```api.js``` (/API) with the latest contract address and run with ```node api.js``` on port 3000. (API server and ZKP layers completed...)
6. Start PostgreSQL database (/DB) on port 3306. (Database layer completed...)
7. Interact with Web UI to create entries for two users within their preferences.
8. API server will find the match and trigger ZKP layer to generate the corresponding proof.

# Some Maths

The problem is treated as a constraint satisfaction problem and formulated with the following way:

$$
\begin{align}
& x_{ii'} \cdot (\lambda_{ij} - \lambda_{i'j}^{min}) \geq 0, \forall \lambda_{ij} \in \lambda_{i} \\
& x_{ii'} \cdot (\lambda_{i'j}^{max} - \lambda_{ij}) \geq 0, \forall \lambda_{ij} \in \lambda_{i} \\
& x_{ii} = 0  \\
& x_{ii'} \in \{ 0, 1 \}
\end{align}
$$

where $\lambda_{ij}$ is the _j_ th attribute of the _i_ th user, $\lambda_{ij}^{min}$ and $\lambda_{ij}^{min}$ are the minimum and maximum preferences of the _i_ th user on the _j_ th attribute, $x_{ii'}$ is the binary decision variable (i.e. 1 if matched, 0 if not matched), $i$ and $i'$ are two different users.

The security of _Proofle_ is formulated with the following way:

$$
\begin{align}
c^i & = Comm([\lambda_{i0} \odot \lambda_{i1} \odot \dots \odot \lambda_{i{M-1}}], r^i) \\
c^i_{mm} & = Comm([\lambda_{i0}^{min} \odot \lambda_{i1}^{min} \odot \dots \odot \lambda_{i{M-1}}^{min}], [\lambda_{i0}^{max} \odot \lambda_{i1}^{max} \odot \dots \odot \lambda_{i{M-1}}^{max}], r^i_{mm}) 
\end{align}
$$

where $c^i$ and $c^i_{mm}$ are the resulting commitments of the commitment function $Comm$, $r$ is the large salting value, $M$ is the number of total attributes considered and $\odot$ is the binary concatenation operation.

Proof is generated off-chain for a successful match: 

$$
\begin{align}
\pi^{ii'}[A, B, C] = ZkpGen( & [\lambda_{i'j}^{min} \leq \lambda_{ij} \leq \lambda_{i'j}^{max}], [r^i, r^{i'}\_{mm}, c^i, c^i\_{mm}, pk]) 
\end{align}
$$

where $\pi$ is the resulting proof of the zero-knowledge proof generation function $ZkpGen$ with the list of three curve points $[A, B, C]$ and $pk$ is the proving key. 

Proof is verified on-chain for a successful match: 

$$
\begin{align}
b^{ii'} = ZkpVfy([\pi^{ii'}[A, B, C], c^i, c^{i'}_{mm}, vk])
\end{align}
$$

where $b^{ii'}$ is the resulting Boolean variable of the zero-knowledge proof verification function $ZkpVfy$ and $vk$ is the verification key.
